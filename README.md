### SEIR models

For more information on such simulations and how they work, see:
<https://www.idmod.org/docs/emod/hiv/model-seir.html>

For the purposes of the simulations featured in the briefing, we based
our parameters for COVID-19 on [Ferretti et al
(2020)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188516v2)
as well the [OpenABM-Covid19
parameters](https://github.com/BDI-pathogens/OpenABM-Covid19/blob/master/tests/data/baseline_parameters_transpose.csv).
To account for vaccination taking time to scale, we assumed only 1m
could be vaccinated in the first month of vaccinations.
