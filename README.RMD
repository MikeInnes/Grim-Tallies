### SEIR models

For more information on such simulations and how they work, see: https://www.idmod.org/docs/emod/hiv/model-seir.html

For the purposes of the simulations featured in the briefing, we based our parameters for COVID-19 on [Ferretti et al (2020)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188516v2) as well the [OpenABM-Covid19 parameters](https://github.com/BDI-pathogens/OpenABM-Covid19/blob/master/tests/data/baseline_parameters_transpose.csv). To account for vaccination taking time to scale, we assumed only 1m could be vaccinated in the first month of vaccinations.
